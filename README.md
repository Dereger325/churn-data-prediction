# Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting telecom customer churn with **90% recall** using XGBoost and cost-optimized threshold tuning.

## 🎯 Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-----|---------|
| Baseline | 73% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0.50 |
| **XGBoost (threshold=0.5)** | 75% | 52% | 78% | 62% | **0.84** |
| **XGBoost (threshold=0.3)** | 68% | 45% | **90%** | 60% | **0.84** |

**At optimal threshold (0.3):**
- Catches **90% of churners** (335 out of 374)
- Only misses 39 customers ($46,800 in lost value)
- Creates 411 false alarms ($20,550 in wasted offers)
- **Total cost: $67,350** vs $113,000 at default threshold
- **Saves $45,650** through threshold optimization

## 📈 Model Performance Details

### Confusion Matrix (Threshold = 0.3)
```
                Predicted
              No      Yes
Actual No   [624]   [411]   ← 411 false alarms
Actual Yes  [39]    [335]   ← Caught 335/374 churners (90%)
```

### Why Threshold 0.3?
- Each missed churner costs $1,200 (lifetime value)
- Each false alarm costs $50 (retention offer)
- **Cost ratio:** 24:1 → optimize for recall, accept lower precision
- Threshold 0.3 minimizes total business cost

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Accuracy is misleading** for imbalanced data (73% baseline just predicts majority class)
2. **Business context drives threshold** - default 0.5 rarely optimal
3. **Feature engineering matters** - PricePerService captured value perception
4. **scale_pos_weight critical** for handling 73/27 class imbalance in XGBoost
5. **Contract type dominates** - single most important business lever
